            <p> I'am a passionate baker, an expressive painter, and a proud mom of two 
              incredible kids, But that's not all! In 2021, I embarked on a new journey as a
               Frontend Developer, diving headfirst into online learning. Driven by insatiable 
               curiosity and a love for creating beautiful, efficient user experiences, I've
                immersed myself in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To further enhance
                 my skills, I'm thrilled to have secured a spot in the prestigious online
                  Frontend Developer course at Folkuniversitetet in Gotenbergg, where I'm studying
                   from 2022 to 2024. I'm currently seeking an internship opportunity to apply
                    and expand my knowledge in a real-world setting. My journey in Frontend Development 
                    has just begun, but I am excited about
               the endless possibilities and the many creative solutions I will build!   </p>
